-	Organise Utilities.h
	-	Some header files are only used in a couple of files and so they don't need to

		easier to read

-	Primitive shapes

	-	Maybe add circles. Maybe.

-	General code
	-	Cut out unnecessary code
		-	Collision code can be cut down heaps, it has a fair bit of unused code
		-	Framework header has crap loads of sprite functions, it 
			only needs a few of them
	-	Comment everything, pretty much nothing has decent comments
	-	Some classes don't have constructors and destructors that do anything...

-	Documentation
	-	Simple start guide on how to use engine

-	Test Project
	-	Redo map reloading to update collision code as well
